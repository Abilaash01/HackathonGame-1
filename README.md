# HackathonGame

Hello judges,
  To run our website, first you will have to clone the master branch to a location you are comfortabe with. After doing so,
open up the terminal (command prompt) and go to the HackathonGame directory. Next go to the PandemicDragandDrop directory and
type the following code into the terminal -> node server.js and press enter. You will be given a link, copy and paste that link
into google chrome to launch it. As a backup if that doesn't work you can navigate your file explorer to PandemicDragandDrop ->
public and open the index file to launch the game as well.

Thank you,
Team Collateral
